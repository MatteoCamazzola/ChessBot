# Board Format
The board is stored in a list of lists, essentially a 8x8 grid  
[* * * * * * * *] Row: 0  
[* * * * * * * *] Row: 1 White Pawns  
[* * * * * * * *] Row: 2     
[* * * * * * * *] Row: 3  
[* * * * * * * *] Row: 4    
[* * * * * * * *] Row: 5  
[* * * * * * * *] Row: 6 Black Pawns   
[* * * * * * * *] Row: 7

Note that index <b>0 0</b> corresponds to position <b>a1</b> on the chess board  

Similarly, index <b>7 7 </b> corresponds to position<b> h8 </b>on the chess board  

Thus, as the board looks in the diagram above, white will start at the top and black will start at the bottom
